!! simulation input for hydrodynamic simulation
!!
!! simulation parameters: (1) = name of the simulation, (2) = simulation time, (3) = time step
hydro_test_1	10.0d0	1.0d0
!!
!!
!! coupling: (1) = switch for coupling (0 no coupling =  / 1 = coupled with structural simulation)	RIGHT NOW ONLY 0 IMPLEMENTED!
